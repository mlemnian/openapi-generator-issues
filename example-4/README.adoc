= Setup

There is one open-api.yaml file that references one path file that is then referencing four parameters, two schemas and one special attribute.

== Build

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean compile
----

== Results

=== Positive

* This setup will be rendered correctly in VS Code using 42Crunch.vscode-openapi plugin

image::vs-code.jpg[]

* redocly lint will successfully validate the api (`npm install && npm test`)

=== Negative

* openapi-generator maven plugin will not successfully validate the api: +

creating only `Ov12DTO.java` and `Ov10DTO.java``



* openapi-generator maven plugin *will create multiple duplicated classes*: +
see:
** `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/ErrorCodeOv12DTO.java`
vs. `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/Ov12DTO.java`
** `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/PagedStuffOv10DTO.java`
vs. `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/Ov10DTO.java`
** `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/StuffOv10DTO.java`
vs. `./target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/api/model/Ov101DTO.java`
* some of the classes are not named correctly: +
|===
|example-1 |example-2
|ErrorCodeOv12DTO.java (duplicate Ov12DTO.java) +
PagedStuffOv10DTO.java +
StuffOv1AddressDTO.java +
StuffOv1DTO.java +
StuffOv1SupplierDTO.java
|ErrorCodeOv12DTO.java (duplicate Ov12DTO.java) +
PagedStuffOv10DTO.java (duplicate Ov10DTO.java) +
StuffOv10AddressDTO.java +
StuffOv10DTO.java (duplicate Ov101DTO.java) +
StuffOv10SupplierDTO.java
|===
* The name `Ov101DTO` is used here because the duplicate for `PagedStuffOv10DTO` is already named `Ov10DTO`. +
It looks like that:
** every time, there is an external referenced schema in the (base) api file, a duplicated class is generated
* This setup will *not* be rendered correctly in IntelliJ ultimate
