= Setup

There is one open-api.yaml file that references one path file that is then referencing four parameters, two schemas and one special attribute.

The three parameters are referenced like in example-2:

      $ref: './shared-api-spec/components/parameters/header/{PARAMETER_NAME}/pv1.x.yaml#/{PARAMETER_NAME}'

== Build

./mvnw clean compile

== Results

=== Positive

* This setup will be rendered correctly in VS Code using 42Crunch.vscode-openapi plugin

image::vs-code.jpg[]

* swagger-cli (4.0.4) `npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli` outputs open-api.yaml is valid
* redocly lint will successfully validate the api (`npm install && npm test`)

=== Negative

* openapi-generator maven plugin will not successfully validate the api: +
