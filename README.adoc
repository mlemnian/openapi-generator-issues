= Purpose 

This repository was created to collect multiple different scenarios in which the `org.openapitools:openapi-generator-maven-plugin:6.4.0` does have problems
generating code from a valid OAS 3.0.1 file because of referencing multiple external files.

The basis is the following open-api file:

[source,yaml]
----
include::base-open-api.yaml[]
----

The following examples should create exactly the same result:

* `example-0`
* `example-1`
* `example-3`
* `example-4`

`example-2` only defines `#/components/schemas/paged_stuff_ov1_0` and `#/components/schemas/stuff_ov1_0` inline.

`example-5` is a more simplified version of `example-4` to make debugging easier.
