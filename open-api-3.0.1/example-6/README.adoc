= Setup

There is one open-api.yaml file that references one path file that is then referencing one parameter, two schemas and one special attribute.

This is a simplified version of example-5. The idea was to name each file ov1_{id}.yaml and to reduce the number of referenced files.

== Results

=== Positive

* This setup will be rendered correctly in VS Code using 42Crunch.vscode-openapi plugin

image::vs-code.jpg[]

* swagger-cli (4.0.4) `npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli` outputs open-api.yaml is valid
* redocly lint will successfully validate the api (`npm install && npm test`)

=== Negative

* openapi-generator maven plugin will not successfully validate the api: +
